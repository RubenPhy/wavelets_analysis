\section{Context and Rationale}

The analysis and prediction of financial signals are fundamental challenges in finance, with direct implications for investment decision-making, risk management, and market stability. These challenges arise from the complex, dynamic, and often non-linear nature of financial data, which include time series of asset prices, credit risk indicators, and volatility measures. Traditionally, statistical and econometric methods, or linear regressions, have formed the basis for modeling these phenomena. However, the exponential increase in the volume of financial data, along with its growing heterogeneity, has highlighted the limitations of these conventional techniques in effectively capturing complex patterns and temporal dependencies.

In this context, Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques have emerged as transformative tools in financial analysis. These methodologies allow for the modeling of non-linear relationships between variables, learning from large volumes of data, and making accurate predictions in noisy and dynamic environments such as financial markets. For instance, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have shown advancements in predicting financial time series, while Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have opened new possibilities for simulating synthetic data. Despite their potential, the application of DL and ML in finance faces significant challenges, such as the interpretability of models, the risk of overfitting, and the need for advanced computational resources.

This thesis is positioned at the intersection of finance and artificial intelligence, exploring how DL techniques and mathematical algorithms can address key problems in the analysis and prediction of financial signals. Specifically, it focuses on three critical areas: asset volatility estimation, generation of synthetic financial time series, and credit rating prediction. These areas are of great practical relevance for investors, risk managers, and regulators, while also offering opportunities to advance the state-of-the-art in financial modeling.

The current state of knowledge reflects a growing interest in integrating DL and ML into finance. In the realm of volatility, recent research has utilized models such as RNNs and GANs to overcome the limitations of traditional methods like GARCH, which assume Gaussian distributions and fail to capture anomalous dynamics. In credit ratings, ML-based approaches have allowed for the incorporation of a larger number of variables and improved predictive accuracy compared to classical statistical methods. Finally, the simulation of synthetic time series has gained attention as a tool for training models in markets with limited historical data, with TimeGAN being highlighted for replicating complex financial patterns. A key concept underpinning parts of this research is Anomalous Diffusion (AD). AD describes transport phenomena where the mean-square displacement (MSD) of a particle does not scale linearly with time, deviating from classical diffusion. This behavior, often linked to non-equilibrium phenomena, can shed light on underlying mechanisms in various systems, including financial domains. Integrating insights from anomalous diffusion into financial analysis could significantly improve our understanding of market behaviors. In the context of this thesis, AD principles are combined with machine learning to estimate the volatility of assets. The AnDi Challenge, for instance, has spurred the development of methods to characterize anomalous diffusion processes using machine learning and statistical methods. However, opportunities remain for better integrating physical concepts, such as anomalous diffusion, with these advanced techniques, as well as for evaluating their practical applicability in real-world financial scenarios. 

\section{Thesis Objectives}

The general objective of this thesis is to develop and evaluate Deep Learning techniques and mathematical algorithms for the analysis and prediction of financial signals, with a focus on three of the main topics that financial analysts are interested in: volatility, time series, and risk (credit ratings). This objective is broken down into three specific objectives, each associated with an article in the compendium, which contribute complementarily to the central purpose:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Article 1: Volatility as an anomalous diffusion process}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Specific objective:} To estimate the volatility of financial assets using the anomalous diffusion exponent and to classify market movements into specific diffusion models (ATTM, CTRW, FBM, LW, SBM).
\item \textbf{Contribution:} To introduce an innovative measure of volatility based on physics concepts, such as anomalous diffusion, to offer a more detailed view of market dynamics compared to traditional metrics.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Article 2: Generation of trajectories with TimeGAN to model anomalous diffusion in financial markets}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Specific objective:} To utilize TimeGAN to generate synthetic datasets that reproduce statistical and temporal patterns of anomalous diffusion models, with an emphasis on Fractional Brownian Motion (FBM) and stock returns.
\item \textbf{Contribution:} To provide a tool for generating realistic synthetic data, useful for training models in markets with scarce historical data, thereby expanding financial simulation capabilities.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Article 3: Estimation of credit ratings with Machine Learning techniques}

\item \textbf{Contribution:} To increase the accuracy of credit rating predictions through advanced ML models and explainability techniques, such as SHAP, with direct applications in risk assessment.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize} 

\subsection{Background}

The analysis and prediction of financial signals have been central themes in financial research, driven by the need to understand and anticipate market behavior in complex and dynamic environments. The scientific literature has addressed this challenge from multiple perspectives, including statistical and econometric methods, and more recently, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. Below is a critical review of the main approaches related to the three thematic axes of the thesis: volatility estimation, credit rating prediction, and the generation of synthetic financial time series.

In the field of financial volatility, traditional econometric models, such as ARCH, GARCH, historical standard deviation or implied volatility, have been widely used to model the conditional variance of financial time series. These models have limitations in capturing non-linear or anomalous dynamics. In recent years, research has explored DL-based approaches, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their variants, like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM), to model complex temporal dependencies in financial series. Furthermore, concepts from physics, such as anomalous diffusion (AD), have begun to be integrated into financial analysis to describe price movements that do not follow standard Brownian processes. The AnDi Challenge, for example, has focused on characterizing anomalous diffusion processes through machine learning.

Another powerful technique for analyzing financial time series is **Wavelet Analysis**. Unlike Fourier transforms, which decompose a signal into sine waves of infinite duration, wavelets are localized in both time and frequency. This allows for a multi-resolution analysis that can capture transient phenomena, such as market shocks or volatility clusters. Wavelet transforms have been successfully applied to decompose financial data into different time scales, denoise signals, and analyze correlations between financial assets at different frequencies.

In the area of synthetic data generation, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful tool for simulating time series in domains with limited data. In finance, models like TimeGAN have been proposed to generate synthetic financial trajectories that preserve the statistical and temporal properties of real data.

In the field of credit ratings, classical statistical methods, such as logistic regressions and linear probability models, have dominated credit risk prediction. Recently, ML techniques, such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM, have gained relevance for their ability to model non-linear relationships and improve accuracy. However, a persistent challenge is the lack of interpretability of these models. Explainability methods, such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), have begun to be used to address this problem.

\subsection{Areas for Advancement}

Despite advances in the literature, several areas offer opportunities for improvement, justifying the need for this research and the contributions of the articles in this compendium:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{In volatility estimation:} Although DL-based models like LSTM and BLSTM have improved volatility prediction, the integration of physical concepts, such as anomalous diffusion, offers further avenues for exploration. There is an opportunity to further develop volatility measures that combine interdisciplinary approaches to offer a deeper understanding of price fluctuations.

\item \textbf{In credit rating prediction:} ML models have demonstrated superiority over statistical methods, but the lack of interpretability remains a hurdle for their adoption in regulated financial contexts. Enhancing the interpretability of these models can improve their practical applicability in risk management and financial decision-making.

\item \textbf{In synthetic data generation:} The application of TimeGAN in finance is promising, yet there is a need for approaches that specifically model anomalous diffusion patterns in financial time series. Generating synthetic data that accurately replicates the statistical and dynamic properties of real markets remains an area for development.

\item \textbf{In signal analysis techniques:} While this thesis focuses on anomalous diffusion and deep learning, the application of other advanced signal processing techniques, such as **wavelet transforms**, could offer complementary insights. Future research could explore hybrid models that combine wavelet-based decompositions with the deep learning architectures proposed here to potentially improve forecasting accuracy.

\end{itemize}

The articles in this thesis address these areas by introducing a new volatility measure based on anomalous diffusion, developing an interpretable model for credit ratings using ML and SHAP, and proposing a TimeGAN-based approach to generate synthetic time series that model anomalous diffusion, thereby contributing to the advancement of knowledge in these areas.

\subsection{Theoretical Framework}

This research is grounded in an interdisciplinary theoretical framework that combines concepts from quantitative finance, machine learning, deep learning, and the physics of complex systems. The main theoretical foundations and key concepts are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Anomalous Diffusion (AD):} Derived from statistical physics, this concept describes transport processes that do not follow standard Brownian motion, characterized by an anomalous diffusion exponent ($\alpha$). In finance, AD is relevant for modeling price movements with long-term temporal dependencies and non-Gaussian distributions.

\item \textbf{Deep Learning for Time Series:} Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly LSTM and BLSTM, are fundamental for modeling temporal sequences with long-term dependencies. These architectures are used to process financial time series, capturing dynamic patterns in volatility and synthetic trajectories.

\item \textbf{Machine Learning and Explainability:} Ensemble models, such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM, are based on statistical learning theory. Explainability, based on SHAP values, is derived from cooperative game theory, where the contributions of each variable are quantified based on their impact on predictions.

\item \textbf{Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):} GANs, and particularly TimeGAN, are based on game theory and adversarial learning, where a generator and a discriminator compete to produce synthetic data indistinguishable from real data.

\item \textbf{Wavelet Analysis:} Wavelets are mathematical functions that cut up data into different frequency components, and then study each component with a resolution matched to its scale. They are used for analyzing non-stationary signals, like financial time series, as they provide a time-frequency representation of the signal. Unlike the Fourier Transform, which gives only frequency information, the wavelet transform gives both time and frequency information, allowing for the localization of power and variance in the time-frequency plane. This multi-resolution analysis is particularly useful for detecting structural breaks, volatility clustering, and other localized phenomena in financial data.

\end{itemize}

These theoretical frameworks provide a solid foundation for the analysis and interpretation of the thesis results.

\section{General Methodology}

Although each article employs specific methodologies adapted to its particular problem, the thesis adopts an integrative approach that combines Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and classical financial algorithms. The main methods include:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{LSTM and BLSTM Neural Networks:} In the analysis of financial asset volatility, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) networks are employed to model long-term temporal dependencies in financial time series.
\item \textbf{Ensemble Models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM):} Used in the article on credit rating prediction, these methods are applied in classification and regression tasks due to their robustness and ability to handle large heterogeneous datasets.
\item \textbf{Generative Adversarial Networks (TimeGAN):} In the article on trajectory generation, TimeGAN, a specific GAN architecture designed for time series, is used to create synthetic data that replicate statistical and temporal patterns of anomalous diffusion models.
\item \textbf{Explainability Techniques (SHAP):} Implemented in the article on credit ratings, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values are used to interpret the predictions of machine learning models.
\end{itemize} 

The thesis also acknowledges other advanced methodologies in financial signal processing, such as **Wavelet Analysis**, which provides a valuable framework for multi-scale decomposition and analysis, complementing the time-domain focus of the recurrent neural networks used in this work.
